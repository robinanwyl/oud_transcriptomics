Understanding Transcriptomic Effects of Opioid Exposure Across Neurodevelopmental Stages in Organoid Models

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a crisis that affects millions of people in the United States. Our aim is to use transcriptomics data from two donor hiPSC-derived organoid models (Kim et al, Ho et al) to investigate the effects of opioid exposure on gene expression during early stage development and adulthood. Differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis (overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis), and transcription factor activity inference were performed on the Ho et al (2024) bulk RNA-seq dataset and Kim et al (2024) single-cell RNA-seq dataset. To ensure robust comparison between bulk and single-cell transcriptomic methods, both pseudobulk and single-cell methods were used to identify differentially expressed genes in the Kim et al dataset. As a result, we discovered significance in neurodegenerative and sex-specific transcription factors and pathways when each model was subject to opioid exposure. Overall, brain organoid models can provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of action and neurodevelopmental stage-specific effects of opioid use.
