**Understanding Transcriptomic Effects of Opioid Exposure Across Neurodevelopmental Stages in Organoid Models**

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a crisis that affects millions of people in the United States. Here we analyze transcriptomics data from two human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoid models to investigate the effects of opioid exposure on gene expression during early stage development (Kim et al 2024) and adulthood (Ho et al 2024). Differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis (overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis), and transcription factor activity inference were performed on the Kim et al single-cell RNA-seq dataset (GEO GSE260711) and Ho et al bulk RNA-seq dataset (GEO GSE210206). Our findings indicate that opioid exposure may affect certain transcription factors and pathways related to brain function and sexual development, with greater disruption of normal brain activity in the developing brain and greater sex-specific effects in the adult brain. The notebooks in this repository contain figures and analysis for our presentation and written report.
